# dgws-api
A convenience Python wrapper for the DiscoveryGate Web Service (DGWS)

The aim of the project is to create wrapping functions with few parameters for some of the most used services of DGWS that will allow us to call them easier.
The project does not aim to work with all available services, nor does it aim to allow complete customization of the service calls.
